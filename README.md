This repository contains code for an updated version of the Pacbot competition. 

There are three sub-folders, one for each part of the competition's infrastructure:
* `bot_client`: sample Python code for creating a Pacbot high-level client and algorithm
* `server`: a Go (programming language) implementation of the Pacbot server and game engine
* `web_client`: a Svelte-based (JavaScript web frontend) client to serve as a visualizer and game console
