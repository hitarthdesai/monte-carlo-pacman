Setting up instructions for GitHub cloning

My preferred code editor is VScode so would recommend downloading that and will have steps for that. If you prefer some other editors, lmk and we will figure it 

Steps to setting everything up [feel free to ask questions in Discord and during our meetings]
Download VScode and Python on your laptop [make sure to add Python to the path during installation]
Sign into GitHub using VScode
make a folder on your laptop and clone the repo
make a file and use the following cmds to push it:
1. git add . 
2. git commit -m "<Custom message>"
3. git push
and then you should be able to see the file reflected on GitHub
