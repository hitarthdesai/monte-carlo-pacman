This is how you can change the address of the TOF sensors using arduino

Motivation:
So all TOF have the same i2c address. To access 4 tof sensors, we will need to create multiple buses and cycle between them; or we have to use a multiplexer. To avoid this, we just change the i2c address of the tof sensors.

Steps:
1)Connect the tof sensor to arduino uno [SDA goes to A4 and SCL to A5]
2)download the adafruit zip file and upload it to the arduino. Uploading can be done by clicking on sketch and then upload library and then add.zip library
3)run the check code to see the current i2c address
4)run the change address (remember to change the i2c address in the code)
5)run the check code again to see the new i2c address

The i2c address of the tof sensors are as follows:
N:0x29
S:0x30
E:0x31
W:0x32
